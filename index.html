  <h1>My homeTown</h1>
  <h2>Belfast</h2>


  <p> Belfast is the city in which I grew up in. 
    
    Over the past generation the city has changed into becoming a more vibrant and dynamic city.

    It is a city that is very up and coming in the tech boom and currently links the UK with the rest of Europe.

    It is a place where I spend my time when I am not travelling.

    It has beautiful surroundings and wonderfully connected to some great land marks from the Giants Causeway,
    to the Great Hedges and many places of where the Game of Thrones were shot.

    Belfast is well connected to Derry, Dublin and beyond.

    Although a little island on the edge of Europe, we are very well connected to the USA, Europe and beyond.
